Given a linked list of N nodes. The assignment it's find the middle of the linked list. For example, if the linked list is
1-> 2-> 3-> 4-> 5, so the middle of the node is 3
If there are two nodes in the middle(in this case, when N is even), print the second element of the middle.
If the given linked list is 1-> 2-> 3-> 4-> 5-> 6, therefore the middle node of the list is 4.
