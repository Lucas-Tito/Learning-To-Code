Given the head of a simple linked list, agroup all the nodes with odd and even indexes and return the reordered list. The first node is considered odd and the second node is even and so on. Not that the relative order inside the odd and even groups need too stay how it where on input. You need to solve this problem in O(1) complexity of extra space and O(n) complexity of time.
