Polish notation was proposed by Polish logician Jan ≈Åukasiewicz in 1924. In this notation, operators appear before their operands. Reverse Polish notation was proposed in 1954 by Arthur Burks, Don Warren and Jesse Wright and independently in 1961 by Friedrich L. Bauer and Edsger W. Dijkstra to assist in the process of evaluating expressions in programming languages. An expression in reverse Polish notation does not need to use parentheses since each operator has a fixed number of operands. In addition, we do not need to define operator precedence and/or associativity rules. An expression in reverse Polish notation can be evaluated easily with the aid of a stack.
