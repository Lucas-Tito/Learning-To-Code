Bubble Sort is the simper sort algorithm that works swapping repeatedly the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm isn't suitable to big data groups, because it's complexity of time is the average and can be pretty slow in the worst case scenario.

<br> <br>
## Input
The first line has a integer N (1 <= N <= 5000) representing the amount of elements of vector A. <br>
The second one has the positive integer elements of vector A.

ex: <br>
5 <br>
1 3 2 5 4 <br>

## Output
THe program prints the number of interation to program needed to sort the elements.
