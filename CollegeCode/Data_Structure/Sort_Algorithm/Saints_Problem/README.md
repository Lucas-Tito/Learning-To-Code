<h1 align="center">Description</h1>

<p>
    Antônio was very skeptical. He didn't believe in God. His friends, without saying anything, said that he should go to a church and that God would give him access to really call him to help the faith divinely and financially help the Saints.< br>
He went to the altar of Saint Anthony and said: <br>
If you are saint that they say you are, I will give you R$ 20.00.<br>
Antônio put his hand in his pocket and saw that his wish was granted. Surprised, he  gave the promised R$20,00. Excited, directed to the altar of St. Paul and gave him:
<br>Double the amount I don't have and I'll give you R$ 20.00.<br>
  
Again, Antônio took his hand in his pocket and, seeing that São Paulo had made his request, gave him the R$ 20.00. Excited, he went towards the altar of São Pedro and said:
<br>Double the amount I don't have and I'll give you R$ 20.00.<br>

São Pedro complied with the request, Antônio gave the 20.00 for his offer, which he had no money.
