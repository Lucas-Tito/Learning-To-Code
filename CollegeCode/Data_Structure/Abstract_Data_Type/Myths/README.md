<h1 align="center">Descrição</h1>

<p align="center">
John is a great myth hunter. He will present the myth that "lightning does not strike twice in the same place". The city of Quixadá is the city with the highest occurrence of lightning in the world. John got a report with the occurrences of each lightning in the city in the last 5 years.
<br>
The city of Quixadá is 500 meters wide and 500 meters long, it will be divided into 250,000 quadrants. The recording system stores the quadrant in which the lightning struck. As the quadrants are relatively small, John decided that if two rays fall in the same quadrant then they can be considered to have fallen in the same place.

<br> <br>
## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer representing the number of lightnings records in the report.<br>
Each of the following NN lines contains 2 integers X, YX,Y representing the record of a lightning that struck in the quadrant whose coordinates are (X, Y)(X,Y)

ex: <br>
5 <br>
1 1 <br>
2 3 <br>
3 3 <br>
4 2 <br>
4 4 <br>

## Output
The program prints the number 0 if no lightning strikes in the same place, or the number 1 otherwise.<br>
(Note: 1 is printed even if there are more than 1 pair of lightning bolts that have landed in the same place.)
